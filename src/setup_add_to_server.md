# Adding to your Discord Server

The very first, and the very basic, step of using IgKnite is to add it to your precious Discord servers. Traditionally, most of the Discord bots that we see today are hosted already by their corresponding maintainers, and IgKnite is no exception too. <br>

## Method 1: The Link

This method has been on Discord for a while now, and involves [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) URLs.

- Just [click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1274430156928319489&permissions=63084479115255&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands) without going to the website to do the same. <br>

## Method 2: The Profile

This method, unlike the previous one, is new and uses Discord's [In-App Authorization]() feature. 

1. If you have a friend who has IgKnite 'injected' in their Discord server, then you can head over to that server and click on IgKnite's avatar to toggle its profile view.

2. See a large button saying **'Add App'**? Click it and you will be prompted to choose which server you would like to have IgKnite. Note that you might also be asked for an authentication code if you have two-factor authentication enabled in your Discord account.

3. Click on '**Continue**'. At this stage, you will see a bunch of ticked options. These represent the global permissions which allow IgKnite to run properly (don't untick any of them, otherwise you might see errors popping in once you start using the bot).

4. Finally, fill in the CAPTCHA requirements to add IgKnite to your Discord server.
