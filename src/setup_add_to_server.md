# Adding IgKnite to your Discord Server

The very first, and the very basic, step of using IgKnite is like any other Discord bot. Traditionally, most of the Discord bots that we see today are hosted already by their corresponding maintainer, and IgKnite is no exception too.

## Method 1: The Link

This method has been on Discord for a while now, and involves [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) URLs.

<br>

- If you head over to [IgKnite's official website](https://igknitedev.github.io/), you will see a button labelled **'Inject'** (that is what we call it here; fancy, right?) Simply click it and you will be redirected to one of Discord's child websites which will allow you to add IgKnite to your Discord server. 

- Or, you can just [click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1016637486702792735&permissions=1505385246135&scope=bot%20applications.commands) without going to the website to do the same.

## Method 2: The Profile

This method, unlike the previous one, is new and uses Discord's [In-App Authorization]() feature. 

<br>

1. If you have a friend who has IgKnite 'injected' in their Discord server, then you can head over to that server and click on IgKnite's avatar to toggle its profile view.

2. See a large blue button saying **'Add to Server'**? Click it and you will be prompted to choose which server you would like to have IgKnite. Note that you might also be asked for an authentication code if you have 2FA enabled in your Discord account.

3. Click on '**Continue**'. At this stage, you will see a bunch of ticked options. These represent the global permissions which allow IgKnite to run properly (don't untick any of them, otherwise you might see errors popping in once you start using the bot).

4. Finally, fill in the CAPTCHA requirements to add IgKnite to your Discord server.
